## Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Autonomous Self-Managing Team
```
Continuous Runtime + Democratic Voting + Hierarchical Memory + Self-Learning
→ Fully autonomous team that runs 24/7, makes democratic decisions, 
  maintains context, and continuously improves
```

### Pattern 2: Knowledge-Building Collective
```
Knowledge Graph + Semantic Search + Memory Consolidation + A2A Protocol
→ Distributed knowledge acquisition with consensus-based validation
  and semantic organization
```

### Pattern 3: Specialized Task Force
```
Domain Agents + Task Management + Resource Allocation + Performance Monitoring
→ Specialized team optimized for specific domain with efficient 
  task execution and resource usage
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Self-Improving Democratic Team
```python
from advanced.continuous_agent_runtime import ContinuousAgentRuntime
from advanced.democratic_voting_engine import DemocraticVotingEngine
from advanced.self_learning_engine import SelfLearningEngine

# Initialize components
runtime = ContinuousAgentRuntime("team-001")
voting = DemocraticVotingEngine()
learning = SelfLearningEngine("team-001")

# Create team that runs continuously, votes on decisions, and learns
def team_work():
    # Execute tasks
    # Make democratic decisions
    # Learn from outcomes
    pass

runtime.start(team_work)
```

### Knowledge Management with Hierarchical Memory
```python
from tools.knowledge_graph import KnowledgeGraphTool
from tools.hierarchical_memory import HierarchicalMemoryTool

# Build knowledge base
kg = KnowledgeGraphTool()
memory = HierarchicalMemoryTool()

# Add knowledge
kg.add_entity("Python", "language")
memory.store_memory("Python is versatile", level="semantic")

# Retrieve with context
results = memory.retrieve_memory(level="semantic", context="programming")
```

## Next Steps

2. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize for scale
3. **Documentation** - Comprehensive API documentation
4. **Example Projects** - Real-world usage examples
5. **Monitoring Dashboard** - Visual monitoring interface
