# AI Agent Rules

Comprehensive rules and guidelines for AI agents operating in CBW Agents ecosystem.

## Overview

These rules provide operational guidelines for AI agents to ensure security, reliability, quality, and effective collaboration in multi-agent democratic systems.

## Rule Categories

### 🔒 Critical Priority (Must Follow)
Rules that are **mandatory** and violations may result in system failure or security breaches:

- **[Security & Privacy Rules](security_privacy_rules.md)** - Data protection, access control, credential management
- **[Memory Management Rules](memory_management_rules.md)** - Memory allocation, cleanup, optimization

### ⚡ High Priority (Should Follow)
Rules that are **strongly recommended** for system reliability and quality:

- **[Code Quality Rules](code_quality_rules.md)** - Testing, documentation, security best practices
- **[Communication Rules](communication_rules.md)** - Response quality, user experience, collaboration
- **[Error Handling Rules](error_handling_rules.md)** - Prevention, recovery, resilience patterns
- **[Testing & Quality Rules](testing_quality_rules.md)** - Coverage, automation, quality gates

### 🚀 Medium Priority (Recommended)
Rules that **improve** system performance and maintainability:

- **[Performance Rules](performance_rules.md)** - Response time, resource usage, scalability
- **[Documentation Rules](documentation_rules.md)** - Standards, knowledge management

### 🤝 Collaboration Priority (Multi-Agent Systems)
Rules specific to **multi-agent democratic systems**:

- **[Democratic Voting Rules](democratic_voting_rules.md)** - Voting mechanisms, consensus building
- **[Delegation Rules](delegation_rules.md)** - Task delegation, responsibility transfer
- **[Communication Protocol Rules](communication_protocol_rules.md)** - Message formats, protocols

## Quick Reference

See **[RULES_INDEX.md](RULES_INDEX.md)** for a complete index of all rules with quick lookup.

## Using These Rules

### For AI Agents
1. Read rules in priority order (Critical → High → Medium → Collaboration)
2. Reference **RULES_INDEX.md** for quick lookups during operation
3. Follow **must follow** rules without exception
4. Apply **should follow** and **recommended** rules when applicable

### For System Administrators
1. Review **security_privacy_rules.md** first
2. Configure **memory_management_rules.md** for your environment
3. Customize rules based on your system requirements
4. Monitor compliance through audit logs

### For Multi-Agent Systems
1. Ensure all agents follow **democratic_voting_rules.md**
2. Implement **communication_protocol_rules.md** for inter-agent communication
3. Use **delegation_rules.md** for task distribution
4. Monitor agent collaboration and consensus building

## Rule Updates

Rules are versioned and updated based on:
- Security requirements
- System performance observations
- User feedback
- Multi-agent collaboration patterns

**Current Version**: 2.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-08

## Compliance

Agents should:
- Log rule compliance metrics
- Report rule violations
- Suggest rule improvements
- Adapt to rule updates
